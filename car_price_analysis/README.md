Report: Key for Used Car Prices

# Introduction

This report provides insights into the factors that most significantly impact the price of used cars, based on an analysis of a dataset containing information on over 400,000 vehicles. The aim is to help the dealership optimize their inventory strategy, make informed purchasing decisions, and effectively price vehicles to align with market trends and consumer preferences.

## Primary Findings

- Year of Manufacture

    * Newer cars tend to be priced higher, with a clear positive correlation between the year of manufacture and car price. However, the impact starts to diminish for vehicles older than 10 years, indicating that beyond a certain age, the vehicle's condition and mileage become more influential.

- Mileage (Odometer Reading)

    * Mileage is a key driver of used car prices. Cars with lower mileage generally command higher prices, as consumers perceive them as having less wear and tear. Vehicles with fewer miles are often considered more reliable and likely to require fewer repairs.

- Manufacturer and Model

    * Certain manufacturers, such as Toyota, Honda, and Ford, have shown a higher resale value compared to others. Popular models within these brands, like the Toyota Camry or Honda Civic, maintain their value longer due to high demand and reliability.

## Recommendations for Inventory Management

- Focus on Low-Mileage Vehicles: Prioritize acquiring vehicles with lower mileage, especially those under 50,000 miles, as these tend to sell faster and at higher prices.

- Emphasize Reliable Brands and Models: Focus on acquiring well-regarded brands like Toyota and Ford. High-demand models retain their value longer and are easier to sell.

## Conclusion
- By focusing on factors like vehicle age, mileage, condition, and brand, the dealership can make more strategic purchasing decisions. These insights will help maximize profitability, reduce time on the lot, and better align inventory with customer demand.
